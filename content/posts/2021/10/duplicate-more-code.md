### Create Fewer Dependencies
Every time we share code dependencies are created. We need to determine if the dependencies are worth the benefit gained from sharing code.

### Not Really The Same
Sometimes its tempting to share code because it looks the same, we have to determine if it is truly the same.

### Duplicate Now, Consolidate Later
Start with duplication and if in the end things are the same, consolidate. It's harder to take things apart than it is to join them together.
