My coworker recently described some work as "sideways". Sideways work comes out of no where and is urgent. Sideways work is not inherently bad, it might be very important. Panic in the moment can create a facade of importance.

Here are some questions to ask yourself both before and after sideways work.

**Before**
1. Is the problem and solution clearly defined?
2. Why is this work urgent?
3. How long has it been since the last piece of sideways work?
    1. Is this related?
4. Is there a due date?
    1. Why was that due date chosen?
5. Are there consequences if this work is not completed by the due date
    1. Are these consequences meaningful?
6. Could this work be completed later and still get done by the due date?

**After**
1. Was the work still relevant when it was completed.
2. How long after the work was completed until was it used?
3. Do the people involved feel, in retrospect, that if the work were to come up again tomorrow it would be as urgent as it was initially felt.
4. Is there an easily identifiable source of this sideways work? Communication failure, natural disaster, and so on.
    1.  Could this work have been prevented?
