We live across the street from an old neighborhood, not that old, but old enough. At some street corners youâ€™ll still see old signs - signs made of stone, low to the ground, and with street names etched nicely into both sides. These signs were not easy to make, they were not easy to move, and they were not easy to update. So why have I come to love these old and unused signs?

They made a commitment.
