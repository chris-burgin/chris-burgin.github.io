This is a post for someone who knows how to make sourdough.

### Ingredients

300g [White Whole Wheat](https://shop.kingarthurbaking.com/items/stone-ground-white-whole-wheat-flour)

700g [All Purpose](https://shop.kingarthurbaking.com/items/unbleached-all-purpose-flour)

720g [Water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water)

40g - 60g Sourdough Starter

### Instructions

In a large bucket combine ingredients, let sit 15 minutes.

Using a wet hand and leaving the dough in a bucket, fold each side of the dough into the center and press. Let sit 20 minutes, repeate 2 more times.

Rest dough on the counter for 12 - 18 hours, until the dough has doubled. If it takes 20 it takes 20, you want it to double. If you want it to go faster use even more starter.

Turn onto floured surface, divide in half, and shape however desired. See [this King Arthur post](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/learn/guides/sourdough/bake) and scroll down to learn about shaping.

Bake. I use a cast iron dutch oven pre heated in a 500f oven. Bake with the lid on for 30 minutes, off for 10. Your baking method will depend on what shape dough you made.
