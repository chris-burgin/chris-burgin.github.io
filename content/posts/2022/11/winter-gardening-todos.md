Don't pull up your tomatoes and close up shop, theres lots still to do. This is an unordered list of things you might consider.

## Plant Garlic

I normally wait for the first frost and then plant when I see it is going to warm back up for a few days. I am not sure what impact this has but I am happy with our results. I plant 6" apart with rows 18" apart and find that to be as close as I can go and still acheive large cloves.

Plant your biggest cloves to get the biggest bulbs.

## Leaves and Straw

Put leaves all over your garden, as many as you can get your hands on. Mulching them up with the lawnmower helps them break down quicker.

If you don't have many leaves throw down a bunch of straw. I will put 2 or 3 inches of straw and then put 4 inches of leaves on top of that. You will not be able to add enough organic material.

## Chickens

Block any westward openings on the coop to pevent heat loss through wind. Throw down a bunch of extra bedding the coop to keep the birds warm. If you are going to put lights up to keep your birds laying go ahead, we have decided not to.

## Collect Flower Seeds

There are tons of great flowers you can collect seeds around the first frost. We collect them from plants we like while we walk around the neighberhood. Go steal some plants.
