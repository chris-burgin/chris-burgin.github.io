I couldn't quite think of how to say this...

... We get lazy and stop designing, instead we fix the problem with a sign.

... We get lazy and stop designing, then we start designing with signs.

... When we stop designing we start designing signs.

... Your home doesn't have signs.


When you first come to a building a sign can help you find your way, but its going to keep that building from ever feeling personal. It would be better if we could design intuitive buildings.
