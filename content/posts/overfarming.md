It's now or never. In business it's easy to fall into this trap, if we don't act now company X is going to eat our lunch.

A farmer says it's now or never. He need to grow twice as much corn this year to win out over the other guy. Next year the same farmer says it's now or never, he needs to grow twice as much corn as last year or he will lose. When the harvest comes he produces less than 2 years ago while the other guy has produced a steady crop.

A company says it's now or never. They need to release twice as many features this year to win out over the other company. Next year the same company says it's now or never, they need to release twice as many features as last year or they'll lose. When the year ends they've released less than 2 years ago, while the other company has produced a steady set of features.

The question in both of these cases is recovery time. Both have produced the same amount, but one needs to recover and one does not.
