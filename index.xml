Sideways work comes out of no where and is urgent. Sideways work is not inherently bad, it might be very important. Though panic in the moment can create a facade of importance.
Here are some questions to ask yourself both before and after sideways work.
Before
Is the problem and solution clearly defined? Why is this work urgent? How long has it been since the last piece of sideways work?</description></item><item><title>Spring and Summer 2021</title><link>https://chrisburg.in/posts/2021/10/summer-2021/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chrisburg.in/posts/2021/10/summer-2021/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Stupid Door</title><link>https://chrisburg.in/posts/2021/09/stupid-door/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chrisburg.in/posts/2021/09/stupid-door/</guid><description>I was looking at the doors in our house and all I could think was &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s stupid&amp;rdquo;.

A farmer says &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s now or never&amp;rdquo;, he needs to grow twice as much this year. Next year the same farmer says &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s now or never&amp;rdquo;, he needs to grow twice as much as last year. When the harvest comes he produces less than 2 years ago while his neighbor has produced a steady crop.
A company says &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s now or never&amp;rdquo;, they need to release twice as many features this year.</description></item><item><title>Equilibrium</title><link>https://chrisburg.in/posts/2021/09/equilibrium/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chrisburg.in/posts/2021/09/equilibrium/</guid><description>Farming, like everything, has an equilibrium.
