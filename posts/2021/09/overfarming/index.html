<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s now or never.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A farmer says &ldquo;it&rsquo;s now or never&rdquo;, he needs to grow twice as much this year. Next year the same farmer says &ldquo;it&rsquo;s now or never&rdquo;, he needs to grow twice as much as last year. When the harvest comes he produces less than 2 years ago while his neighbor has produced a steady crop.</p>
<p>A company says &ldquo;it&rsquo;s now or never&rdquo;, they need to release twice as many features this year. Next year the same company says &ldquo;it&rsquo;s now or never&rdquo;, they need to release twice as many features as last year. When the year ends, they released fewer features than 2 years ago, while the competition has released a steady set of features.</p>
