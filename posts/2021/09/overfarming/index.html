<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s now or never.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A farmer says it&rsquo;s now or never. He need to grow twice as much corn this year to win out over the other guy. Next year the same farmer says it&rsquo;s now or never, he needs to grow twice as much corn as last year or he will lose. When the harvest comes he produces less than 2 years ago while the other guy has produced a steady crop.</p>
<p>A company says it&rsquo;s now or never. They need to release twice as many features this year to win out over the other company. Next year the same company says it&rsquo;s now or never, they need to release twice as many features as last year or they&rsquo;ll lose. When the year ends they&rsquo;ve released less than 2 years ago, while the other company has produced a steady set of features.</p>
<p>The question in both of these cases is recovery time. Both have produced the same amount, but one needs to recover and one does not.</p>
