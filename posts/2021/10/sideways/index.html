<h2> Sideways </h2>
<p class=date> October 4, 2021 </p>
</header>
<p>My coworker recently described some work as &ldquo;sideways&rdquo;. Sideways work comes out of no where and is urgent. Sideways work is not inherently bad, it might be very important. Though, panic in the moment can create a facade of importance.</p>
<p>Here are some questions to ask yourself both before and after sideways work.</p>
<p><strong>Before</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Is the problem and solution clearly defined?</li>
<li>Why is this work urgent?</li>
<li>How long has it been since the last piece of sideways work?
<ol>
<li>Is this related?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Is there a due date?
<ol>
<li>Why was that due date chosen?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Are there consequences if this work is not completed by the due date
<ol>
<li>Are these consequences meaningful?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Could this work be completed later and still get done by the due date?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>After</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Was the work still relevant when it was completed.</li>
<li>How long after the work was completed until was it used?</li>
<li>Do the people involved feel, in retrospect, that if the work were to come up again tomorrow it would be as urgent as it was initially felt.</li>
<li>Is there an easily identifiable source of this sideways work? Communication failure, natural disaster, and so on.
<ol>
<li>Could this work have been prevented?</li>
</ol>
</li>
