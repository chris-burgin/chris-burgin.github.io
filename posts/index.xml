The clothesline is the surest sign of spring.

10oz or less. Coffee stays hot for longer, easier to hold. Ceramic. Metal travel mugs are not a pleasure to hold. Lightly Colored Inside. I want to see my coffee. Good Lip. Medium thickness with a subtle curve.</description></item><item><title>Winter Ain't Bad</title><link>https://chrisburg.in/posts/2021/11/winter-aint-bad/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chrisburg.in/posts/2021/11/winter-aint-bad/</guid><description>Winter ain&amp;rsquo;t bad, it reminds us of when work changed with the season. Plant in the spring, grow in the summer, harvest in the fall, and maintain in the winter. Very few of us have the opportunity to live by the seasons now, let&amp;rsquo;s enjoy the subtle reminder of changes they used to bring.</description></item><item><title>Heavy. Inconvenient. Signs.</title><link>https://chrisburg.in/posts/2021/11/cheap-signs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chrisburg.in/posts/2021/11/cheap-signs/</guid><description>We live across the street from an old neighborhood, not that old, but old enough. At some street corners youâ€™ll still see old signs - signs made of stone, low to the ground, and with street names etched nicely into both sides. These signs were not easy to make, they were not easy to move, and they were not easy to update. So why have I come to love these old and unused signs?</description></item><item><title>What Kind of Man</title><link>https://chrisburg.in/posts/2021/10/what-kind-of-man/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chrisburg.in/posts/2021/10/what-kind-of-man/</guid><description>So material a difference does it make, not what ills are suffered, but what kind of man suffers them.

We need to determine if the dependencies are worth the benefit gained from sharing code.
Not Really The Same Sometimes its tempting to share code because it looks the same, we have to determine if it is truly the same.
Duplicate Now, Consolidate Later Start with duplication and if in the end things are the same, consolidate. It&amp;rsquo;s harder to take things apart than it is to join them together.</description></item><item><title>The Company Metaverse</title><link>https://chrisburg.in/posts/2021/10/company-store/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chrisburg.in/posts/2021/10/company-store/</guid><description>The Company Metaverse</description></item><item><title>William Willett Just Wanted To Golf</title><link>https://chrisburg.in/posts/2021/10/william-willet-just-wanted-to-golf/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chrisburg.in/posts/2021/10/william-willet-just-wanted-to-golf/</guid><description>William Willett just wanted to finish his round at dusk and now we change the time.</description></item><item><title>Too Many Plants</title><link>https://chrisburg.in/posts/2021/10/too-many-plants/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chrisburg.in/posts/2021/10/too-many-plants/</guid><description>I started too many plants this summer.

Sideways work comes out of no where and is urgent. Sideways work is not inherently bad, it might be very important. Though panic in the moment can create a facade of importance.
Here are some questions to ask yourself both before and after sideways work.
Before
Is the problem and solution clearly defined? Why is this work urgent? How long has it been since the last piece of sideways work?</description></item><item><title>Spring and Summer 2021</title><link>https://chrisburg.in/posts/2021/10/summer-2021/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chrisburg.in/posts/2021/10/summer-2021/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Stupid Door</title><link>https://chrisburg.in/posts/2021/09/stupid-door/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chrisburg.in/posts/2021/09/stupid-door/</guid><description>I was looking at the doors in our house and all I could think was &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s stupid&amp;rdquo;. Our doors seemed to be designed without purpose, that turned out to be very far from the truth.

A farmer says &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s now or never&amp;rdquo;, he needs to grow twice as much this year. Next year the same farmer says &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s now or never&amp;rdquo;, he needs to grow twice as much as last year. When the harvest comes he produces less than 2 years ago while his neighbor has produced a steady crop.
A company says &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s now or never&amp;rdquo;, they need to release twice as many features this year.</description></item><item><title>Equilibrium</title><link>https://chrisburg.in/posts/2021/09/equilibrium/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chrisburg.in/posts/2021/09/equilibrium/</guid><description>Farming, like everything, has an equilibrium. At once you can either store for the future or take from the future but there are limits to both.
